-Lyric Writer-

I wanted a simple web-based text editor for writing song lyrics, then decided to write my own.

Languages used: Html, Javascript, Php (for saving)

Features:

-Save/Load to and from .txt files
-Syllable counter on the left side
-Light/Dark mode
-Increase/decrease text size (doesn't save text size)

The code is a bit messy, and there are some glitches but I hope it can help some of you.

Known issues:

-Syllable count scrolling doesn't match up perfectly.
